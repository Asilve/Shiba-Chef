# ShibaChef
#### Why "ShibaChef"?
I like Shiba Inu - they're cute. I also didn't want to give the project a generic name like "Meal Planner" 

## Description
ShibaChef is a personal desktop meal planner and shopping list generator designed for my own use. When planning groceries, I often found myself scrambling to decide what to meal prep for the next few days and then manually figuring out which ingredients I need. 

ShibaChef is my answer to this issue - it generates meals I can batch-cook over a specified number of days and creates a shopping list of the necessary ingredients. While other apps can accomplish this, ShibaChef is tailored specifically to my preferences.

This project is being developed in **Java**, as I am currently learning it for university. Building ShibaChef allows me to further strengthen my Java skills and experiment with concepts beyond my coursework.

#### Project Status
🏁 Project finished as of now. There may be future revisions to improve the app, but i currently want to explore other projects.

#### Planned Features and To-Do List
✅ **Planned Features:**
* Generate Meals based on batch-cooking preferences.
* Generate a shopping list for selected meals.
* Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* Sound effects for UI interactions.

🔧 **Current To-Do List**
* ~~Implement Meal class.~~
* ~~Implement File Manipulation for meal storage.~~
* ~~Implement User input for number of days.~~
* ~~Implement Random meal generator.~~
* ~~Implement Shopping list generator.~~
* ~~Source art / assets.~~
* ~~Develop GUI.~~
* ~~Implement sound effects.~~
* ~~Create .exe~~

#### Considerations for Expansion
ShibaChef is designed for personal use, But if I ever wanted to make it more general-purpose, here are some key areas to address:
1. **Ingredient Database** - Currently, only ingredients I commonly use will be included. Expanding this would be necessary for broader usability.
2. **Mobile Version** - Right now, ShibaChef is a desktop application, but a mobile-friendly version could be a future possibility.
3. **Visual Assets** - Most assets will either be self-made, AI-generated, or copyright-free, which may impact the app's aesthetics.
4. **Customization** - The app will be built around my own meal-planning style. If I made a public version, more flexibility would be needed (eg, formatting the configuration for batch-cooking.)

## How to use
ShibaChef is a very easy to use app that allows you to generate a meal plan and add your own meals. On the Main Menu page you can see three buttons, one to generate meals, one to submit a new meal and a final button to exit the program.

Upon clicking the first option, you can see a box in the centre for you to enter a number of days you want to have meals planned for. This number has to be between 2 and 7 days. A home icon is in the top corner to return to the main menu page.

After inputting a number of days, the app generates (if able) a number of meals that you can navigate between using the buttons on the bottom. Each meal has its own page featuring its name, number of days you can batch cook the meal for and its meat, carb, veg and misc items.

On the side of this page has three buttons, "Home" which takes you back to the home screen, "Back" which takes you back to the number of days page (so you can randomize the meal selection again if you don't like the current selection) and "Shopping" / "Meals" button. This final button swaps between the individual meals page and a shopping list page, which features a combined list of ingredients for every meal.

Here is an example of the shopping list, showing what ingredients are needed for every meal generated.

Finally the generate meal page. A name and number of days must be submitted, including a meat and carb profile. The vegetable and misc profiles aren't required as each meal has its own unique profile and some meals may not have the following ingredients. After adding all relevant ingredients, press submit.

If you wish to place Application on your desktop or elsewhere, you must first create a shortcut to this executable. To do this, right click on the .exe and navigate to the following option. From there, you can move the shortcut elsewhere on your own machine, while leaving the original exe in the project folder. Failing to do this will result in txt files, images and audio files not opening correctly.
