# ShibaChef
#### Why "ShibaChef"?
I like Shiba Inu - they're cute. I also didn't want to give the project a generic name like "Meal Planner" 

## Description
ShibaChef is a personal desktop meal planner and shopping list generator designed for my own use. When planning groceries, I often found myself scrambling to decide what to meal prep for the next few days and then manually figuring out which ingredients I need. 

ShibaChef is my answer to this issue - it generates meals I can batch-cook over a specified number of days and creates a shopping list of the necessary ingredients. While other apps can accomplish this, ShibaChef is tailored specifically to my preferences.

This project is being developed in **Java**, as I am currently learning it for university. Building ShibaChef allows me to further strengthen my Java skills and experiment with concepts beyond my coursework.

#### Project Status
ðŸš§ Currently in Development - Features and Intallation details will be updated as progress is made.

#### Planned Features and To-Do List
âœ… **Planned Features:**
* Generate Meals based on batch-cooking preferences.
* Generate a shopping list for selected meals.
* Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* Sound effects for UI interactions.

ðŸ”§ **Current To-Do List**
* ~~Implement Meal class.~~
* ~~Implement File Manipulation for meal storage.~~
* Implement User input for number of days.
* Implement Random meal generator.
* Implement Shopping list generator.
* Source art / assets.
* Develop GUI.
* Implement sound effects.
* Create .exe

#### Considerations for Expansion
ShibaChef is designed for personal use, But if I ever wanted to make it more general-purpose, here are some key areas to address:
1. **Ingredient Database** - Currently, only ingredients I commonly use will be included. Expanding this would be necessary for broader usability.
2. **Mobile Version** - Right now, ShibaChef is a desktop application, but a mobile-friendly version could be a future possibility.
3. **Visual Assets** - Most assets will either be self-made, AI-generated, or copyright-free, which may impact the app's aesthetics.
4. **Customization** - The app will be built around my own meal-planning style. If I made a public version, more flexibility would be needed (eg, formatting the configuration for batch-cooking.)
